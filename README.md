# dotfiles

I'm trying to join all dot files because I'm using some devices and never remember what things (or aliases) can I do. And, also I wanted a dotfiles repo as I had seen to good developers.

I started copying and adapting the code at Rakefile from [YADR project](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) and now as it seems repo is outdated I'm trying to do it manually and with minimal changes.

## Setup macOS

- Install [Brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)

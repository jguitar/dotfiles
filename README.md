# dotfiles

I'm trying to join all dot files because I'm using an iMac and a laptop and never remember what things (or alias) can I do. And, also I wanted a dotfiles repo as I had seen to good developers.

I've copied and adapted the code at Rakefile from [YADR project](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles)

### How to use it

1. Install [YADR project](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles)
2. Clone this repo and `rake`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jguitar/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
rake
```
